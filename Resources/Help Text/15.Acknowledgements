AcknowledgmentsJPEGView was — for the most part — written, conceived, produced, and documented by Aaron Giles.  Behind the scenes, however, were quite a number of other rather important people you should know about.Dirty WorkFirst I want to thank all those other programmers who were nice enough to do some of the dirty work for me.  Their efforts in particular are responsible for making JPEGView work so smoothly:Troy Gaul wrote Infinity Windoid, the code that draws the way cool floating windows everyone likes so much.Ramon Felciano wrote Mercutio, the code which draws the menus and handles lots of weird keypresses.The Independent JPEG Group, headed by Tom Lane, wrote the original color reduction algorithm, which was used as the basis for JPEGView’s color reduction, in addition to the JPEG decompression code which is used as an alternative to QuickTime.Ross Williams wrote LZRW1, the data compression technique used to squeeze the on-line help down to a reasonable size.Prerelease HellA big part of putting together a new release of JPEGView is the serious amount of testing that is needed to make sure everything works on all (most?) machines.  To this end, I would like to acknowledge all the alpha and beta testers who have contributed toward testing this JPEGView release:Bob Andrews, Jim Brunner, Justin Collins, Shawn Connelly, John Coolidge, Ramon Felciano, Mike Fetzer, Troy Gaul, Stephen Haase, Paul Jacoby, Paul Jensen, Dave Johnson, Hugh Johnson, David Johnston, Mark Krueger, Tom Lane, Richard Lim, Tim Lowe, Robert Mah, Tom McDougal, Sam Neal, Tim North, Victor Norton, Brian Olson, Dan Pendergrass, Steve Poole, Charlie Reiman, Axel M. Roest, Eric Sack, Francois Schiettecatte, Bart Sears, James N. Stricherz, Steve Unger, Chris Webster.Friends in High PlacesA few special words of thanks are in order for several Apple employees who have made all the difference in helping me make JPEGView a success.Mark Krueger was the guy who originally noticed JPEGView and helped me change it from a really basic hack into a robust QuickTime application.Tim Lowe has been instrumental in helping me adopt and adapt to new Apple technologies — especially AppleScript — faster than I would have ever been able to without him.And finally, thanks to Jim Pelkey and Linda Haas, for organizing the PowerPC developer’s kitchen, and for making it such a great success.Others Who Have Made a DifferenceTom Lane wrote the second-largest help chapter, General JPEG Questions & Answers, and deserves some additional praise for founding and heading the Independent JPEG Group, whose free source code has made the widespread use of JPEG images possible.John Coolidge, I recently discovered, is responsible for sorting and maintaining the burgeoning JPEG image archives at wuarchive.wustl.edu.  Here’s hoping he can find the time (or the help!) to finally get all those pictures sorted!More than 950 registered JPEGView users have so far taken the time to send in their postcards and letters, and believe me, the response has kept me going — keep ’em coming!Finally, I want to thank my wonderful wife Shanti, for being (relatively) understanding and even supportive of my programming addiction/obsession.
