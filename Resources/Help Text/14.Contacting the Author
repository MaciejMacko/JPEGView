Contacting the AuthorJPEGView is postcardware, meaning that if you find yourself using JPEGView regularly, I am asking you to send me a postcard.  So don’t be shy, just scribble your name, address, an email address if you have one, and any comments you wish (or none, if you prefer) on a postcard and slip it in your local mailbox addressed to me at:Aaron Giles182 E. 95th Street 11ENew York, NY  10128U.S.A.What do you get for your postcard?  Well, if you give me an email address that I can access through the Internet, I plan on providing updates and information through a mailing list I’ve set up.  You will likely receive information about new versions before everyone else.  Also, postcards provide encouragement; if I know many people are using JPEGView and find it useful, I have far more incentive to improve it in the future.  So… if you’d like to see an even more powerful image viewer in the future, a postcard would certainly help!Any user of JPEGView 3.0 or later also has the option of becoming a fully registered user.  Registered users who send in a one-time registration fee of US$20 receive a printed, bound copy of the full JPEGView documentation, along with an official JPEGView 3.2 release disk, containing the complete JPEGView 3.2 release plus a few of my favorite JPEG images.  My current U.S. Mail address can be found in the chapter Contacting the Author, later on in this documentation.Overseas users who wish to avoid the hassle and fees of international money orders are asked to simply send the equivalent of US$20 in cash, plus about US$3 extra for postage (everything is sent airmail).  Although this is not recommended by the post office, you can usually get away with it as long as you do well to mask the fact that there is cash enclosed, i.e., make sure it is wrapped in sufficiently opaque paper.Note that registration is optional; the only “payment” that is required for individual use of JPEGView is a postcard.Finally, a very simple unlimited site license is available for universities and companies that wish to make JPEGView 3.3 an officially supported product — and it typically only costs you the low low price of a few individual registrations (US$50 to be exact)!  Contact me via email (giles@med.cornell.edu) or U.S. Mail (at the address above) for full details, or just go ahead and send in the cash (most people seem to do it anyway!)  Purchase orders are welcome.Organizations and individuals who are interested in distributing JPEGView with their products should contact me first before doing so.  I’m usually pretty flexible about licensing, especially for “good causes”, so if you’re interested, please don’t hesitate to get in touch with me about it!I would also love to hear any comments, suggestions, bug reports, etc., from anyone using JPEGView.  To get them to me, you can either include them with your postcard (preferred), or, if you’ve already sent your postcard, you can send them to me via email on the Internet at:giles@med.cornell.eduor through email on America On-Line, using the address:AGilesIf you send me bug reports that appear to be QuickTime-related, I will forward them to the QuickTime engineers at Apple.
