JPEGView Source CodeCopyright ©1991-2001, Aaron GilesAuthor contact: mac@aarongiles.comThis archive contains the full (I think) source code to JPEGView version 3.3, which was the last version I released back in 1994. I've gone through it a bit, but not thoroughly. If there is anything missing, or anything that shouldn't be included, please don't hesitate to contact me.There are various project files and other stuff included, but the final JPEGView was built on MPW with PPCC.A lot has changed since I wrote this code. Computers got way faster and memory got way cheaper. JPEGView began as the first Mac application I ever wrote and blossomed into something way beyond what I imagined. I still feel proud of this thing, though I cringe to look at some of my old source code. Maybe someone will find it useful still.SOFTWARE LICENSEThis software is UNSUPPORTED.
