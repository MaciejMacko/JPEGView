Announcing the release of JPEGView 3.3 — May, 1994Enclosed is version 3.3 of my postcardware application JPEGView, a fast, powerful image viewer for both 680x0 and PowerPC Macintoshes.  JPEGView can open and display images in JPEG, PICT, GIF, TIFF, BMP, MacPaint, or Startup Screen formats.  This latest release of JPEGView adds some new functionality and fixes a few bugs that were in the previous (3.2.1) release; users of previous versions are strongly encouraged to upgrade to this latest version.IMPORTANT NOTE: JPEGView *requires* System 7.0 or later to run.Any user of JPEGView 3.0 or later also has the option of becoming a fully registered user.  Registered users who send in a one-time registration fee of US$20 (add US$3 if you are overseas) receive a printed, bound copy of the full JPEGView documentation, along with an official JPEGView 3.3 release disk, containing the complete JPEGView 3.3 release plus a few of my favorite JPEG images.  Full details are given in the on-line help (available from the help (a.k.a. “balloon”) menu).Please note that registration is optional; individual use of JPEGView obligates you only to send me a postcard.Briefly, here are the important new features in version 3.3:    • much more stable memory management with QuickTime and virtual memory    • JPEG decompression now available even when QuickTime is not installed    • full drag-and-drop support, for “Drag-aware” systems    • rewrote high quality drawing for a significant speedup    • added the ability to remember cropping on images    • added new icon styles, plus ability to specify icon area    • improved operation of the JPEGView JFIF Preview QuickTime extension    • numerous bug fixesAnd a general JPEGView overview:    • it’s essentially free (postcardware), simple, and easy to use    • requires only 800k, but will effectively use more memory to run faster    • produces some of the highest-quality images available on the Macintosh    • decompresses images faster than almost any other Macintosh image software    • provides an excellent user-configurable slide show    • automatically scales images to fit on your monitor    • has handy full screen windows (without the menubar) for large images    • supports multiple-monitor systems extremely well    • includes exhaustive on-line documentation and balloon help    • is System 7-studly, featuring full AppleScript support and 32-bit cleanliness    • native code takes full advantage of PowerMacintosh systems    • comes with a cool colorful JPEG test image :-)Once again:     JPEGView is postcardware.  The concept is simple:    If you like it, you are obligated to send me a postcard of some sort.    If you want a printed, bound manual and official release disk, register by sending in         US$20.Enjoy!Aaron GilesInternet:  giles@med.cornell.eduAmerica On-Line: AGilesSnail mail:  Aaron Giles                   182 E. 95th Street 11E                   New York, NY  10128
