Where is JPEGView?The version of JPEGView on this diskette is stored in a Self-Extracting Archive to save space (allowing for more pictures, of course!)  To extract JPEGView and all of the associated files, simply double-click on the Self-Extracting Archive (the file “JPEGView 3.3.sea”), select a folder to extract to, and watch as the JPEGView package gets expanded.A note about PowerPC and 680x0 versionsThe version of JPEGView that ships on this disk is a special version of JPEGView called a “fat binary”.  A fat binary is an application which contains old-style Macintosh code as well as native PowerPC code.  This means that you can launch the application on either type of machine and get the maximum performance.  However, it also means that the application size is a little larger than what you might expect, since there are two different copies of the code.  If you are really tight on space, you might want to strip out whichever type of code you're not using on your system.  It is quite likely that in the near future there will be utilities available to strip out the unnecessary portions of that code, but until then you can accomplish this task by hand.  For 680x0 systems, you need to clear out the “data fork” of the file; a fairly common utility called Anonymity should be able to do this quite nicely.  For PowerPC systems, you can use ResEdit to delete all the CODE resources from the application.However, if space isn't all that tight, then don't worry about it — you never know when having both types of code available might be handy!Happy viewing!Aaron GilesInternet:  giles@med.cornell.eduAmerica OnLine:  AGiles
